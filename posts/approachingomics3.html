      <h1>The Geometry of Proteins</h1>
      <p>The thumbnail image is what's called a Ramachandran plot. Let's figure out what's going on 
      there. Here's a handy image: </p>
      <img src="../images/proteins.jpg" width="500px">
      <p>The image shows how amino acids bond together, and repeating this process for more 
        amino acids on either end will make a protein. Look at the 'alpha' carbon, in light blue 
        on the bottom right. There is an N and a C coming off. The 'torsional' angles 
        that these two things attach at are called psi and phi respectively. There are some 
        physically viable pairs $(\varphi,\psi)$. The subset of these that appear in some 
        experimental sample is plotted in the Ramachandran plot.
        <img src="../images/ramachan.jpg" width="500px">
        <br>There are two dominant structures that proteins fold into: $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets.
        These regions are clearly marked on the above Ramachandran plot, and you can stare at this and 
        figure out why they would cause helices or sheets.
      </p>
      <h1>Prions - Folding Gone Wrong</h1>
      Proteins can fold into unlikely, but physically possible, configurations, which 
      don't have the desired functional effect. In fact, in cases of terrible fortune, these 
      misfoldings can be 'contagious', encouraging the other proteins near them to misfold into the same 
      prion form. This can cause whole clumps of tissue to degenerate, causing the famous 
      mad-cow disease. For example, a $\beta$-sheet might turn into a $\beta$-helix.
