          <p>This game theory construction helps us understand the relationship between auctions, sports, and other competitions. 
            A simple war of attrition proceeds as follows: </p>
          <li>There is a prize worth e.g $V$.</li>
          <li>In each round, one can either <i>fold</i> or <i>fight</i>.</li>
          <li>The cost to fight another round is e.g $c$.</li>
          <li>Once all but one player has folded, the last player receives the prize.</li>
  
          <p>
          <b>Example 1:</b>
          There are $3$ players, including you and me. The prize is $V=5$ and it 
          costs $c=1$ to fight. We both fight, and the third player folds. Next round, 
          you fight but I fold. In total, you paid $1$ and gained $5$, so your payout was $4$. (You 
          don't pay when everyone else folds.) 
          <br><br> 
          <b>Example 2:</b>
          There are $2$ players. They both fold, and receive half of the prize each 
          (the prize is divisible).
          <br><br>
          <b>Example 3:</b>
          The 'rounds' of the previous game are essentially discrete time
          intervals. We will now consider continuous time. Your time is worth $1$ per second. 
          The prize is still $5$. I fold first, $3$ seconds in. The third player folds to you at $4.5$ seconds,
          so you win but incur a cost of $4.5$. Your payout is $0.5$.
          <br><br>
          One can also consider any mixture of discrete and continuous time, and incorporate elements of 
          randomness. 
      </p>
      <h2>The First Big Question:</h2>
      <p>
      <b><i>When should you fold in the continuous version of the game with two players?</i></b>
      <br><br>
      If there is some technically "optimal" strategy, then we can think of it as a CDF - a distribution
      telling us how likely we should be to fold in any time interval. Furthermore, an optimal strategy would
      work for both sides, so both us and the opponent would use the same CDF. 
      <br>Consider a time interval $(t,t+h)$. Let's say your time is worth $c$ per second. 
      The CDF you both obey is $P(t)$ with $P'(t)=p(t)$. Then \[c \cdot h = V \frac{p(t)}{1-P(t)},\] 
      since LHS is the value you lose between $t$ and $t+h$ and RHS is the expected value you gain. We set 
      these exactly equal to find the optimal solution. 
      <br><br>
      Letting $h=\mathrm{d}t$ and solving the differential equation for $P$, we find \[P(t) = 1-e^{\frac{-t}{V}}.\]
      To approximate this in your head, you might use the expansion \[P(t)=\frac{t}{V} - \frac{t^2}{2V^2} + \cdots.\]
      <br><br>
      Concretely, $P(t)$ tells us the probability that we have folded at time $t$, given we are playing optimally.
      </p>
      <h2>An Application:</h2>
      <p>
      <b><i>You are completing an extra task with a coworker. Either of you can leave whenever
          you want and go back to usual work for $£20$ per hour. However, the "last man standing" will curry 
          favour from the boss, worth an estimated $£200$. At what point does it become likely that you have
          left, assuming you and he are "playing" optimally?
