      <h1>Structure</h1>
      <p>Let's start by understanding what the lysosome looks like. Note, the lysosome 
        can be thought of as all the processes and locations pertaining to the physical
        thing - when we do lysosomics, we study all the things going in and out and changing 
        inside the physical lysosome.
        <br><br>
        The lysosome is a spherical, membrane bound 'bag', generally smaller than the 
        nucleus but not tremendously tiny. The vacuole of a plant cell is just one big lysosome.
        An animal cell like yours usually has order of 100 or 1000 lysosomes in it. The lysosome 
        pumps protons into itself to maintain a lower pH - a couple of pH points doesn't sound 
        so impressive but it's maintaining a proton concentration of 100x that outside the lysosome. 

        <br><br>
        Remember that the lysosome contains around 50 enzymes that can break things down.
        When the genes encoding these enzymes mutate, disaster can strike. An example follows.

      </p>
      <h1>Gaucher's Disease</h1>
      <p>A rare inherited disease, Gaucher's occurs when the lysosome can't produce an enzyme 
        called GCase, and this allows some lipid to build up in various organs. This can have 
        devastating consequences like bone fractures or even death. <br><br>How would we know for sure 
      if someone has Gaucher's disease? Well, according to the central dogma of cell biology, 
    this enzyme must have been encoded by some DNA, and before that some RNA. 
  Technologies exist to find the counts of certain genes in RNA (the RNA can be swimming around in a 
  sample of cells), 
and one could theoretically analyse the counts of the gene corresponding to GCase and notice 
that the patient doesn't have enough. This is not necessary, as the disease can be detected 
by blood tests and other means, but this is a first look at omics.</p>
<h1>How Do People Count Genes in Cells?</h1>
The technology I referred to earlier is essentially that of 10x Genomics' Chromium, which takes in some 
cells as input and returns (quite accurate) counts of all the genes appearing in the RNA from those 
cells. Apparently you can snag one of these glorified scanners for around $250000 - a steal to 
look into the recipe for your own body. Note that the counts of a certain gene is expected to vary 
even between cells of the same 'type', like two of your own skin cells. The counts of genes between 
different types of cells could vary hugely. We are starting to see why omics is so impressive.
